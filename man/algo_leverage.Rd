\title{This function implements algorithmic leveraging for
linear regression using uniform and leverage score, and the user can
specific subsampling of rows.}
\usage{
algo_leverage(X, Y, algorithm = "leverage", subsampling_rows = 100)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{The design matrix}

\item{Y}{The response variable vector}

\item{algorithm}{including "uniform" and "leverage", user can choose to
use 1 and 2, respectively. Default setting is "leverage".}

\item{subsampling_rows}{number of subsamples to generate. Default setting is
100.}
}
\value{
the beta estimators.

\examples{
n = 500
X = matrix(rt(n, 6),n)
eps = rnorm(n)#error term
Y = - X + eps
